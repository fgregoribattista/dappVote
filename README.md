# DAppVote
DApp Test to Altoros Protofire
## Getting Started
This is a project to response a practice about binary vote in DApp to Altoros Protofire.
### Prerequisites
It is necessary to have in install node.js, npm and webpack-dev-server
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/download/)
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
[webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server)

I use Truffle to framework and Ganache to Test the DApp.
[truffle]( https://truffleframework.com/)
[ganache]( https://truffleframework.com/ganache)

## Running
When you finish cloning the project you can run the DApp:
```
npm run dev
```

In some cases, depend on the test of the network, it is necessary to migrate the contract again.
Ganache example (on Windows):
```

```
